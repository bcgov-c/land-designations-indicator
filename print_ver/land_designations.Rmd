Land designations that contribute to conservation are spatially-defined areas established through legislation or purchased for the protection of nature and cultural values, the conservation of biological diversity and ecosystem services and the management of natural resources. For example, conservation land designations include areas established as parks, areas identified to protect species at risk or cultural heritage, and areas that are identified to manage the balance of nature conservation and economic opportunities. This indicator reports on the status of land designations that are intended to contribute to conservation in British Columbia.


-   Land designations that contribute to conservation are summarized in
three categories: **Protected Lands, Resource Exclusion Areas and
Spatially Managed Areas**. The three categories span a considerable
range in contribution to conservation, with variation in purpose,
scope and strength---with respect to intended conservation
outcomes---and length of the term of the designations.
-   **Protected Lands**---covering 15.4% of British Columbia---includes all
**Parks & Protected Areas** (15.0%) and **Other Protected Lands**
(0.4%) with the *primary* purpose of the *long-term* conservation of
nature and cultural values.
-   **Resource Exclusion Areas**---covering 12.4% of B.C.---includes all
designations that fully exclude one or two resource activities for
the purpose of conservation.
-   **Spatially Managed Areas**---currently covering 24.5% of B.C.---
includes all spatial designations managing or limiting development
or a resource activity for the purpose of conservation, or a spatial
management regime in place to preserve specified elements of
biodiversity but where activity is still allowed to occur. The
designations within this category vary significantly in purpose and
scope of management.
-   More detail on the land designations that contribute to conservation
and the three categories are provided in the Details section below.

## Details of Land Designations that Contribute to Conservation 
-   **Protected Lands (15.4%)**
-   Includes **Parks & Protected Areas (15.0%)**, designations
enacted in legislation with a *primary* purpose of the
*long-term* conservation of nature and cultural values *and*
that are administered by a government parks and protected areas
agency [BC Parks](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/) and [Parks
Canada](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/index.aspx)). Municipal and
regional parks and water supply areas are not included in the
analysis at this time.
-   Includes **Other Protected Lands (0.4%)**, such as B.C.'s
non-governmental organization conservation areas or private
conservation lands. These are designations and lands
administered or owned by a [non-governmental conservation
organization](http://ltabc.ca/publications-a-research/british-columbia-conservation-areas-summary-report-2015-16/)
and managed for the long-term conservation of wildlife habitat
values.
-   Other Protected Lands also includes designations enacted in legislation with a primary
purpose of the long-term conservation of biodiversity and/or
ecosystem services, such as National Wildlife Areas and
Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, both designated by the Government of
Canada, and [Wildlife Management
Areas](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/habitat/conservation-lands/)
designated under the provincial [*Wildlife
Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96488_01).
-   **Resource Exclusion Areas (12.4%)**
-   Includes designations excluding one or two resource
activities---such as forestry, mining or large-scale
hydro-electric development---for the purpose of conservation.
-   The excluded resource activity is often a primary threat to
biodiversity in the established area, making the designation an
important contribution to conservation.
-   Some examples include designations such as no-harvest [Wildlife
Habitat Areas](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/frpa/iwms/wha.html)
designated under the [*Forest and Range Practices
Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/00_02069_01),
[Grizzly Bear Habitat (Class
1)](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/tasb/slrp/plan17.html)
designated under the [*Land
Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96245_01),
and the [Sea to Sky Wildland
Areas](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/tasb/slrp/plan79.html)
designated under the [*Environment and Land Use
Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96117_01).
-   **Spatially Managed Areas (24.5%)**
-   Includes spatial designations managing or limiting development
or a resource activity---such as forestry, mining or large-scale
hydro-electric development---for the purpose of conservation, or a
spatially-defined management regime in place to preserve
specified elements of biodiversity but where activity is still
allowed to occur.
-   Some examples include designations such as conditional-harvest
[Wildlife Habitat
Areas](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/frpa/iwms/wha.html),
conditional-harvest [Ungulate Winter
Range](http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/frpa/uwr/index.html), and
[Visual Quality
Objectives](http://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=C45131B6586243CD8A91D399B5712256)---all designated under the [*Forest and Range Practices
Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/Recon/document/ID/freeside/00_02069_01)---and Important Fisheries Watersheds and other [legal objectives
established for the the Great Bear
Rainforest](https://www.for.gov.bc.ca/tasb/slrp/plan17.html)
under the [*Land
Act*](http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96245_01).

The complete list of included land designations, category information,
data sources, and data licence details is [available in CSV
format](https://github.com/bcgov/land-designations-indicator/blob/master/data-raw/sources_Nov2017.csv). Some designations were
not included at this time due to a lack of a public, authoritative data
source. These will be added to the analysis as they become available.

## Methods

Overlaps among land designations have been accounted for in the
analysis. While B.C. does use aspatial land management tools, this
indicator only reports on *legal, spatially-defined* areas that
contribute to conservation. The analysis presents the current status of
land designations and the intended contribution to conservation---the
effectiveness of land designations has not been evaluated. The [**Python**](https://www.python.org/) and [**R**](http://www.r-project.org) code for repeating the analysis and data visualizations presented on this page is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/bcgov/land-designations-indicator).
